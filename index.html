    <h3 style="color:white" class="text-center"> Intresting Story about the <p style="color: red"> KING KOHLI... </p> </h3>
    <p style="color:white">
      This is one story that has been etched in Ferozeshah Kotla’s history and will be narrated for years to come. It is the tale of an 18-year-old teenager, who loved cricket. An act, which stunned not just his teammates but also his opposition.It was a cold and difficult day for the Delhi Ranji team. They lost 5 wickets chasing Karnataka’s mammoth first innings total. With half of the side back in the hut on the 2nd day itself, it was an uphill task for Kohli and Co. to save the match. The 18-year-old walked out and along with wicketkeeper Puneet Bisht helped reach Delhi 103 at the end of the day’s play, without losing another wicket. Kohli stood solid and unbeaten at 40, but Delhi still needed to go a long way with the last recognized pair in the middle.<p style="color:red">That night, his world turned upside down. His father, Prem Kohli, just 54-years-old, passed away.</p>
    <p style="color:white">
    Kohli faced an awful choice – whether to cremate his father or to go and finish his innings for Delhi. The news of Prem Kohli’s demise had already travelled throughout the Delhi dressing room. Chetanya Nanda was informed that Kohli won’t come to bat and he was asked to pad up. But, his teammates, opposition and even the match officials were shocked to see Virat Kohli arriving in the dressing room in full cricketing gear. He chose to go in and bat.
  
  He played for 281 minutes and faced 238 balls. When he was declared out after scoring a match-saving 90, just before lunch though the bat had brushed the pad as replays showed, his team was clearly out of trouble, with only 36 runs needed to avoid the follow-on.</p>

        <p style="color:white">
          Adding to MS Dhoni's long list of career highlights, he is the only player in history to win the ICC ODI Player of the Year award twice, in 2008 and 2009. On November 1, 2011, MS Dhoni became the second cricket player after Kapil Dev to earn the honorary title conferred upon him by The Indian Territorial Army.
        </p>
        <p style="color:white">
          Dhoni's journey is a testament to the power of hard work, determination, and self-belief. He faced several challenges and setbacks throughout his career, but he never gave up. He believed in his abilities, and he worked hard to achieve his goals. Dhoni's leadership skills are another valuable lesson for young people.</p>
